# Overview

## The Challenge:

Create an interfaces that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in an SQL Employee Tracker database. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Objective is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Once done, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates the interfaces functionality and acceptance criteria.

## User Story
```md

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
